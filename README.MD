# Delta Client Archives

This repository contains the archives of Delta v3.0.0 (b3.x), a [MinecraftForge](https://minecraftforge.net) based hacked client for Minecraft 1.7.10, targetting specicifically the [Paladium](https://paladium-pvp.fr) Minecraft server. 

It was developed by me ([xtrm](https://github.com/xtrm-en)), as well as other small contributors (mainly [FurYzen](https://github.com/FurYzen) and MinRay), from 2018-2020.

## Where are the commits?

The commit history has unfortunately been lost, the last commit being a silly force-push, because apparently I didn't know better lol.  
Last commit date: `Thu Aug 6 16:06:06 2020 +0200`

## How do I make it work?

**You don't**.

This repository is only provided for archival and educational purposes. It is not intended to be used by anyone, and will not be maintained.

Stuff is broken, dependencies are missing, links are dead, and most of all: this is *old* **shitty code** that probably has a dozen more problems. 

A notable dependency might be the [old Delta API](https://github.com/xtrm-en/delta-api-v3), which is also archived.

## License

I don't care. No warrenty, no support, no license. Do whatever you want with it.
